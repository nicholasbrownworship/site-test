      <h2>World Setting</h2>
      <p>The city of Stonecross hums with anticipation.
Banners hang from every balcony, the smell of roasting meats drifts through the streets, and the sound of hammering echoes from the castle walls as servants rush to prepare for the grand celebration — a royal tournament and banquet to honor King Alden’s engagement to Lady Elowyn Lysara.

You’ve each been in the city for only a few days — some as honored guests, others as trusted servants of the crown — when a summons arrived this morning.
A sealed note, stamped with the King’s crest, delivered by a royal courier.
No explanation. No sender.
Only a time, and a place: “The east wing, at dusk.”

Now, as the last light fades beyond the walls of Stonecross, you find yourselves walking the quiet marble halls of the castle. The distant sound of laughter from the courtyards below contrasts sharply with the stillness here.

Whatever this meeting is, it’s not part of the festivities.
And whoever called you here — they mean for this to stay quiet.</p>
