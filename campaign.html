      <h2>World Setting</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Eryndor, a world where magic is both a gift and a curse, and the echoes of ancient wars still shape the lands. Towering mountains pierce the skies, their snow-capped peaks home to reclusive clans of dwarves and stone-shaping sorcerers. Verdant forests stretch for miles, hiding both tranquil glades and lurking predators, and the whispers of fey creatures drift on the wind, promising power—or peril—to those who dare listen.

Eryndor is a land of contrast. In the sun-drenched plains of Lyria, sprawling human kingdoms rise and fall with the ambitions of their rulers, while along the storm-lashed coasts of Veyra, seafaring folk carve out a harsh life amid jagged cliffs and treacherous tides. Deep beneath the surface, labyrinthine caverns and molten rivers of the Undermire pulse with secrets long forgotten—places where the earth itself holds grudges and monstrous denizens await the unwary.

Magic flows unevenly across Eryndor, concentrated in leylines that pulse like the veins of the world. Wizards, clerics, and warlocks alike seek its currents, sometimes bending reality, sometimes inviting calamity. Arcane storms can appear without warning, ripping through cities, while enchanted forests can shift their paths, leading travelers to safety—or doom. In every corner, the supernatural coexists uneasily with mortal ambition, and old treaties between mortals, fey, and elementals are as fragile as spider silk.

The people of Eryndor are as diverse as its lands. Noble houses vie for influence in grand castles, mercenary bands roam the borders, and secretive guilds plot in shadowed alleys. Legends speak of dragonborn heirs, cursed bloodlines, and ancient immortals walking among the living, their motives unknowable. Heroes are not born—they are forged through peril, choice, and consequence. The wrong decision in one small village might ignite war across an entire continent.

Conflict is never far. The remnants of the Crimson Wars linger in the east, where ruined fortresses and haunted battlefields whisper of betrayal and valor. In the west, the Shattered Isles are a haven for pirates and exiles, yet hide ancient ruins that pulse with forbidden magic. Between them, the Veilwood stretches—a primeval forest that moves with a mind of its own, home to druids, fey, and creatures that have never touched the sun. Each region offers adventure, mystery, and danger in equal measure.

In Eryndor, every decision carries weight. Allies may betray you, artifacts may be cursed, and the line between hero and villain is often blurred. Whether your party seeks glory, knowledge, or survival, the world will respond. Kingdoms will rise or fall under your choices, ancient magics will awaken to test your mettle, and stories will be written in fire, steel, and spellcraft.

Step into Eryndor—and make your mark on a world alive with wonder, danger, and endless possibilities.</p>
